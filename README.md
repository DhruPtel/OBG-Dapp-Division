# OBG Dapp Division Proposal

The Oregon blockchain group was created as an initiative to introduce students to the vast amount of opprotunities provided by blockchain technology. In order to do so it has taken innovative steps to capture the exponential growth posted by blockchain technologies and digital assets as a whole. The groups' crypto fund 1.0 aims to take hold and leverage the explosive gains created by crypto currencies while mitigating the risks in order to create growth of capital and facilitate profit making opprotunities in the market. This provides students with the opprotunity to gain more academic knowledge of various projects while also providing hands on experience for money managment. However, another - arguably more important - part of the blockchain technology is neglected in these operations which is the ability to build communities, tools, and financial instruments on top of blockchains themselves. The Oregon Dapp division intends to be an addition to the Oregon blockchain group to foster a more well rounded scope of blockchain technologies. Through a rigorus yet short and adaptive education program the Dapp division plans to foster a community of creators using blockchain technology to introduce students to the vast possibilities of this revolutionizing new technology and connect students to the world of the cryptographic creator economy.

# The Dapp Division

The intent of the Dapp division is to introduce students into blockchain by creating, allowing individuals to explore and create and manage ideas with a decentralized network. web 3.0 is not just a buzz word used to make crypto sound cool, it's an eco-system of tools, communities and infrastructure that is lost to those who are misguided about the world of blockchain, the dapp division wants to show web 3.0 to members in depth. Through learning by creating OBG will be able to tear down the stigam/idea that blockchain is too difficult to understand just because it's an early stage technology. Through adaptive learning we plan to quickly give members the base knowledge they need to not only build Dapps, but be resourceful and learn from their own process of creating. With emphasises on how to read errors you don't understand, how to look for ideas you want to add, how to trial and error OBGs' Dapp division can quickly give members the tools they need to suceed. Members don’t need to create the next uni swap, or even a main net project at all, the ability to put a project on the blockchain, even a test blockchain (where functionality is the same but no valued capital runs through it) can empower students to explore more ideas, and empower them in their own abilities to learn by doing and work in the blockchain space. Posting a project/contract/etc on a test net is the same functional skill as posting a project on main nets, the only difference is they cannot hold money, and it does not cost money to deploy them. Though good for education test nets lack substance, lack community, and lack excitement, using real-world crypto with real-world value the executive development team in the Dapp division will create and manage main net projects that add real-world value to the world of blockchain, and create opportunities to profit off their utility. 

# Structure
Overview: The Dapp division will be a 5 layer internal organization operating under and working for the Oregon blockchain group. 2 layers are delegated education layers: education phase and test net phase, while the remaining 3 layers are delegated development layers: level 1 Dev, level 2 Dev, and executive Dev. The delegated education layers will be a broad scope curriculum, showing members a broad range of technologies and how they work. The test net phase is a test of members' knowledge after the course, members can either choose to work in a group or alone to create a full or medium stack project that will be launched to a test network. Once members complete their testnet phase they will be delegated to their respective development level based on the proficiency of their project, from there they can choose to specialize into one of 3 categories: Creative, Financial, or Infrastructure. Furthermore, once a member is delegated to their respective level they may move up levels based on their work in the club or other criteria. Level 1 and Level 2 devs must help out the education layers of the organization as part of their work in order to hone their skills and get a better understanding of concepts. It is possible to bypass the education phase with the completion of an education test which will be administered by the education director.

* **Education Phase** - At the time of writting the education phase plans to be an adaptive learning program specifically geared toward Dapps (decentralized applications), later on in this proposal we will discuss what "adaptive learning" means in depth. Even though at the time this program is geared toward coding, the Dapp division can create a over all education program, that gives crypto fund members both general overview knowledge of DAOs, Yield Aggrigators, and other projects while also showing them how these organizations work in depth. In any case the education phase will provide members with the knowledge and tools to start exploring their intrests in the blockchain metaverse.
* **Test net Phase** - After completing the education phase of the Dapp division members will be able to prove their proficiency with a test net project. Inorder to get any developer status/position in D.D. members will have to complete a full test net project. Members can either collaberate or individually pitch projects to the exec dev team and if the team approves of their project idea, members will create the project and launch it to the test net. The executive team will review and then allocate members to their respective developer levels.
* **Level 1 Developer** - Level 1 developers are the most casual category of developer that the group will hold. The main goal/purpose of this group is to build their own personal portfolios by building projects and launching them solely to test nets. Furthermore members of L1 will have to help teach new members in the education phase.
* **Level 2 Developer** - Level 2 developers mirror Level 1 developers very similarly, the only difference is that level 2 developers have shown a better grasp/understanding of not only concepts, but also the ability to solve problems and use the tools provided by the education phase. Because of this faucet of Level 2 developers the executive dev team will call on level 2 developers to help them with certain tasks in their projects. This gives level 2 developers more experience working with real main net projects without taking on the stress/responsibility of creating a protocol that will hold/use OBG funds. Level 2 Developers will also help educate new members going through the education phase.
* **Executive Developer** - Executive Developers are the top tier talent produced by the Dapp Division. These members have shown exceptional skill in their ability to use tools and their knowledge to create robust projects that are capable of handling real funds. The Executive Developers will work on main net projects that will hold and use capital to facilitate their operations. Projects created by the executive dev team will be formulated to create profit generating opportunities.

# Adaptive learning 
In the world of blockchain education in the traditional sense of lesson plans, lectures, and even tests don’t help to grow proficiency in the industry. Though blockchain is not as difficult as some might think, blockchain technology is one of the four fronts of innovation of our modern time and has a steep learning curve for those that do not understand it. Furthermore because blockchain is so new there are new topics/ideas to explore every week and fundamental changes in policy/the industry every month. It is a general consensus by all members of the blockchain community that the best way to learn blockchain is by doing. On a base level this means setting up your wallet, going into dapps, and playing around. From a development perspective this is giving people the tools to be able to learn to build on their own. Adaptive learning instead of focusing on certain topics and testing understanding in them, teaches members tools in order to figure out how those topics work by themselves. The group will focus on base knowledge such as how enviroment dependencies work, how certain languages work, etc. However, past this the Dapp division will focus on skills such as how to google, how to use stack overflow, and how to trial and error code to allow members to be more resourceful in their efforts to build ontop of blockchains.

# External Collaberation
The beauty of Dapps (Decentralized applications) is that they are not only meant for developers. In the world of blockchain anything can be digitized and built on top of, this gives D.D. the unique opportunity to collaborate with a lot of different clubs to deliver or create projects of vast ranges. For example, a developer can create an NFT project in which they utalize the skills of art ducko (an art club on campus that focuses on cartoon characters). Or a developer can create a real estate Dapp that tokenizes a property and facilitates buying and selling of those assets with the advice of the UO real estate investment group. The possibility of multiple organizations to collaborate with the creation of dapps is endless.

# Internal Collaberation (How the crypto fund and D.D. coincidence)
The dapp division has the potential to make its own projects that are able to manage money and create profit making opportunities by working in the blockchain ecosystem. Projects like yeild aggregators such as yearn.finance, liquidation protocols like aaves’ loan liquidation, flash loan scripts, and more are potential endevors that the Dapp division can explore. However to do so these projects and the team that builds them needs adept financial information about how money flows in these projects and where and what the most effective strategies are for these protocols to execute. This information can only be created and provided by the analysts in the crypto fund 1.0. Because of the unique landscape of cryptographic capital in blockchain markets, money in crypto flows with a much different purpose, pattern, and pace than other more traditional finance sources that most money management clubs like the Oregon investment group are not used to. These organizations can’t provide the well rounded insights on what the best strategies would be for protocols like these like analysts working closely in the crypto fund.

# Conclusion
The Oregon blockchain group is far from a finished product, there are many aspects of the blockchain community that the club neglects. While the Dapp division doesn’t solve all these issues it provides a baseline for them to be included. Allowing our members to create within the blockchain ecosystem can not only help them get a well rounded and deep knowledge of blockchains, but the tools and strategies they learn can also help them even in their professional lives. The Dapp Division would be a great addision to the Oregon blockchain club as a tool for learning and to build out the culture of our organization.
